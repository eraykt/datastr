* A kind of queue
*dequeue gets the element with the highest priority
*Priority is based on compasable value (key) of each object

Applications in Computers
OS: run(dequeue) the shortest job first
Printer: print(dequeue) the shortest document.

Minimum Priority Queue
We yse a data structure called heap to implement a priority queue.

A Binary Heap --- Structurel property
Completely filled
Bottom level is filled from left to right

Heap Order Property
Any node is smaller than or equal to all of its childern.

parent(i) = floor(i/2);
left(i) = 2*i;
right(i) = 2*i +1;

3 ary tree heap
parent(i) = floor((i+1)/3);
left(i) = 3*i -1;
middle(i) = 3*i;
right(i)= 3*i+ 1

Insert or enqueue
1- Insert into the next avaliable location.
2- Move it up (swap with its parent) until there is no violation for heap order property. This procedure is called Percolate Up.

Delete or dequeue
1- Keep the min, move the last element in the heap to the first place.
2- Move the first element dawn until there is no violation for heap order property. this process is called percolate down,
finally, we return the min which is stored.
