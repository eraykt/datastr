A graph consist of a self of nodes and a set of edges connecting pour of nodes.
A tree has the propert that there is exactly one path (no more no less) between each pair of nodes.

A tree is a graph with no cycle.

Rooted Tree
In a rooted tree, one distinguished node is called the root.

Every node except the root has excatly one parent p, which is the first node after c on the path from c to the root.
(c den root a olan ilk düğüm parent'tır.)

A leaf is a node with no children.
Siblings are node with the same parent.
The ancestors of a node d are the nodes on the path from d to the root.
(ancestor ata demek. roota giden yoldaki her düğüm.)
If node a is an ancestor of node d, then d is descendent of a.
(descendent sonraki nesil anlamına geliyor. ancestor'un tam tersi.)

The length of a path is the number of edges on the path.
The depth of a node n is the length of the path from n to the root.
The depth of the root is zero.

The height of a node n is the length of the path from n to its deepest descendent.

depth -> aşağıdan yukarıya ne kadar yükseğim? roota kadar sayılacak.
height -> yukarıdan aşağıya ne kadar alçağım? en aşağıdaki descendent a kadar say.

The subtree rooted of node n is the tree formed by n and its descendent.

Binary tree
A binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two children.
                    o
                o       o
              o        o   o
            o
              o     

And every child is either a left child or a right child even if it is the only child.

Tree Traversal
A manner of visiting each node once.
preorder traversal -> root left right
inorder traversal -> left root right
postorder traversal -> left right root 

Binary search tree
Each right node is greater than its parent. Each left node is less than its parent.
