A graph G is a set V of vertices and a set E of edges that connect vertices.

G = (V,E)   T = (V,E')

2 types: directed(digraph) & undirected

Path: sequence of vertices with each adjacent pair connected by and edge.
G1 = 1-4-2-5
G2 = 1-2-4-3

Lenght of path: #edges on the path. <1,4,2,5> = 3
Degree of a vertex: #edges incident in vertex.

Digraph
    indegree : #edges directed toward vertex.
    outdegree: #edges directed away.

Graph Representations
1. Adjacency Matrix: |V| by |V| array of booleans.      dense graph

        1           , if (i,j) element of E
a ij=   0           , otherwise

#Maximum possible edges
    undirected graph: (|V|.|V-1|) / 2
    directed graph  : |V|.|V-1|

#Minimum possible edge |V-1|

2. Adjacency List: Each vertex v has a linked list of edges incident (out for digraphs)     sparse graph
Memory used O(|V| + |E|)
